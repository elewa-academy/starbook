## Data Modeling

Data is the heart of your application.  One of the most important decisions you have to make when designing and application is how you will structure your data.  
* What objects will your DB store?
* What properties will each object have?
* How do the different objects relate to each other?

These decisions are challenging to make and will have long-term consequences for how well your application works and how simple it is to expand and maintain.
